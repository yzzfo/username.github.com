NeoFPS is a full suite of tools to craft the FPS you've dreamed of.Make your FPS vision a reality with an asset that solves many of the problems you'll encounter while building a polished FPS game. NeoFPS is not just a character controller. It's a full suite of systems that work together to craft an FPS. From movement and weapons, down to in-game menus and quick-save/load.You design worlds. NeoFPS puts players in them.Official Website • Playable Demo • Documentation • Tutorials • IntegrationsRoadmap • Codecks • Support • Forum Thread • Discord\"NeoFPS is the first FPS template I've tried that feels like it was designed and developed by someone who really understands the genre. It's highly flexible, intuitively organized, thoroughly documented, and fully supported. And it gets a lot of important details right that other FPS tools either mess up or miss entirely.\"Craig Hubbard, Former Creative Director at Monolith Productions- F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon- The Operative: No One Lives Forever- No One Lives Forever 2- Vampire: The Masquerade – BloodhuntKey Features:NeoFPS was developed with the core goals of flexibility, extensibility and control. It enables you to precisely meet your FPS design goals or experiment with new ideas.The core of NeoFPS is a powerful \"motion graph\" visual FSM editor for modelling first person movement, sitting on top of a custom kinematic character controller. Combined with a powerful camera setup and modular firearm system, NeoFPS can build impressive FPS mechanics out of the box.Firearms are assembled from a variety of modules that define their behaviour such as different aimers or reloaders. They are then animated via a combination of keyframed animations and procedural animation features. A variety of custom shaders are provided for render texture scopes or projected holographic sights (including URP and HDRP variations).A full save-game system allows you to use quick-save and load to save everything down to bullets in flight. Alternatively you can selectively save data at checkpoints, or it can be used to persist data such as health and inventory between scene changes.Extensive documentation and tens of deep-dive tutorial videos guide you through the features as you go.

Download the 'Standalone Stress Test' demo to see how MxM stacks up in performance.Included Demo Scene - The Demo Scene included with MxM includes a player controlled Robot Kyle with the ability to run around and perform some parkour vaults. The vault system shown here is for demonstration of MxM event features ONLY and is not intended to be a production ready vault system.What is Motion MatchingMotion Matching for Unity (MxM) is an alternative animation system to mecanim which enables fluid and responsive animation without the need of a state machine. There is no need to specify transitions, define conditions or keep track of complex animation logic. Motion Matching takes care of most of that for you resulting in unlimited starts, stops, plants and turns.Motion Matching achieves this by comparing the pose of the character and desired future trajectory (from player input) to all animations in your library. The system will pick the most appropriate time and clip to jump to. This all happens with lightning speed as it is implemented with Unity's new job system and burst compiler.Who is it for?MxM is not a plug and play asset. You need to understand basic scripting in Unity as an absolute minimum. However, strong programmers will make the most out of this asset. Intermediate level experience with Unity and programming in C# is recommended.MxM supports cut clips but mocap users and studios with high animation bandwidth will reap greater benefits from this asset.Platforms - While MxM may work on mobile devices, mobile platforms are not yet actively supportedDependencies - MxM requires a number of Unity packages from the package manager to work (e.g. Jobs). Some of these may be preview packages. However, these packages all behave in a stable manner with MxM. Please read the quick start guide for details.Animation Requirements - MxM may not work with all animation sets. Transition animations are required for good coverage and continuity. Please read the documentation for more info.Features: (v2.2.5)- Un-structured interactive animation- Fluid, natural and responsive animation output*- No need for state machines and explicit transitions- Powerful event system for character actions- Built in animation warping for actions like parkour - Support for multiple world contacts during actions (e.g. placing the hand on a ledge when vaulting)- Tagging system for control over movement types and stances- Built in layer system  - Fade between mecanim and MxM with a single function call - Lighting fast performance. MxM is multi-threaded and uses Unity's new Job system Burst Compiler and SIMD mathematics library- Blend spaces to cover animation gaps - Custom editors and inspectors to help manipulate data- Support for cut clips as well as uncut motion capture *- Works with most IK systems straight out of the box - Powerful debugging tools- see the documentation for moreAnimation output quality and responsiveness is dependent on the quality and responsiveness of source animations. Not all animation sets will work. Please see animation requirements for more details. Only partial support for 'Unity Animation Rigging' due to Unity bugs and limitations.Documentation:- Quick Start Guide- User Manual- Video TutorialsWarning: Motion Matching is a generic animation system that outputs animation. It does not handle procedural animation / IK or game-play code. A good level of scripting competence is recommended to convey game-play information to the motion matching system.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/mesh-baker/","title":"Mesh Baker","description":null,"body":"Improve performance!

Unlock the power of Unity.Programmers: Add a powerful visual state machine editor to your toolbox. Interface with scripts or extend Playmaker with Custom Actions.THE PLAYMAKER DIFFERENCEEasy To UnderstandOther visual scripting tools simply expose the Unity API (written for programmers) and C# language (programming) as thousands of nodes. If you already know how to code you can probably build what you need, but it's a huge learning curve for non-programmers!PlayMaker takes a higher level approach, offering an intuitive structure with States, Actions and Events to quickly build behaviors. This actually empowers both non-programmers and programmers to create more quickly and efficiently.Production ReadyPlayMaker has been used in hundreds of shipped products including Hearthstone, INSIDE, Hollow Knight, The First Tree, Dreamfall Chapters, Firewatch and more. We've worked with AAA studios to solo indie developers to make sure PlayMaker meets their needs on every platform.PerformanceOther visual scripting solutions use delegates or reflection calls for every single node in the graph. Even simple behaviors need many nodes. This quickly adds up to a heavy hit on performance!PlayMaker actions are C# scripts like any other script in your project. Calling them is quick and efficient. You also need fewer actions to do the same work as dozens of nodes in other visual scripting tools.EcosystemPlayMaker has an active user community with admins and power users online to answer your questions. The Ecosystem Browser provides easy access to a constantly growing collection of custom actions, tutorials, samples, templates etc.Many third party assets have PlayMaker support, with easy to use Actions so you don't have to figure out APIs written for programmers.Features:: PlayMaker Discord Channel :: Build behaviors in an intuitive Graph View. :: Drag-and-Drop Actions - no syntax errors!:: Copy/Paste graphs and save Templates.:: Powerful runtime debugging::: Watch States, Variables, and Events.:: Pause and Rewind time with Debug Flow.:: Extend Playmaker with Custom Actions.:: Watch tutorials on our YouTube Channel.:: Join an active online community.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/amplify-shader-pack/","title":"Amplify Shader Pack","description":null,"body":"180+ Amplify Shader Editor samples for HDRP, URP, and Built-in Renderer.FREE FOR Amplify Shader Editor OWNERS.Checkout at no cost, be sure to use the same account that has your ASE license.SAVE 35% ON Amplify BundleAmplify Shader Editor - Award-winning node-based shader editorAmplify Impostors - 1-Click Impostor CreatorAmplify LUT Pack - 200+ LUT Grading PresetsLATEST HIGHLIGHTS• Updated per ASE editor v1.9.8• Updated support for Unity 6• Optimized package size• Added preview support for URP/HDRP 17x• Added new sample Refraction HDRP• Added support for URP/HDRP 16x• Added support for URP/HDRP 15x• Added support for URP/HDRP 14x• Fixed all samples for URP/HDRP 10x and 12x• Built with Amplify Shader Editor v1.9.2• Improved Start Screen sample importerIMPORTANT• Raised minimum Unity support to 2019.4 LTS• Raised minimum URP support to 10x• Raised minimum HDRP support to 10xOver 180 curated shaders made with Amplify Shader Editor, ready to use and fully editable.

Built-in shaders will work with any Unity version.Includes HDRP/URP shaders been created for versions 10 to 16. You need Amplify Shader Editor to update these shaders in order to make them work properly with other SRP versions. The included shader will be updated whenever necessary, depending on future SRP changes.Using HDRP/URP shaders with an unsupported SRP version, without updating them, will likely render incorrectly or show as Pink/Magenta. This is expected, shaders must be open with the editor and saved to automatically update them to a different supported SRP version.** Amplify Shader Editor sold separately **For additional details on Amplify Shader Editor, check our Overview Video and Manual.Make the change, use the professional tools you crave.

Quickly prototype, save, recolor, and instantiate light flares and sun rays with the onboard tools.CONNECT WITH US:Website | Email | Discord | Playable DemoDistant Lands presents:Lumen: Stylized Light FXCreate beautiful stylized light effects ranging from light flares to halos to god rays to scatters! Lumen is a one-stop solution to stylized, performant volumetric lighting in stylized games.Features THREE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS of light that work together to dramatically stylize your game worlds:Do the lights in your scene feel lackluster? Do you want your audience to feel the warmth of the lights in your game? LUMEN LIGHT FLARES add a subtle halo to the lights in your scene providing an effect similar to that of volumetric point lights. This effect can be turned to the extreme as well filling your scenes with majestic glow and powerful auras—a must for any mystical item that your players may encounter!The LUMEN STATIC RAYS are a simple way to achieve any sort of volumetric ray. Godrays, sunshafts, spotlights, 2D, 3D, or anything in between, these rays do it all! Use these to add interest to your scene, direct the player's eye to important locations, fill the scene with moody lighting, or just make your scenes even prettier!Finally, LUMEN DYNAMIC RAYS use vertex colors and a custom shader to dynamically scale and contort the rays to a specific angle in real-time! Use these rays to track the sun dynamically, point rays at a moving target, or fake real-time volumetric lighting!WHY MESH-BASED EFFECTS?Built on a mesh-based, procedural material, Lumen throws out all of the calculations that most volumetric lighting solutions need by replacing the traditional mathematics with a simple vertex lit shader! This allows your effects to be calculated cheaply so that you can focus on the aesthetics of your scene, without worrying about the framerate decreasing. Beyond this, the lack of textures allows your disk space to be minimized without reducing the quality of the flares and rays that make your scene beautiful!Powerful tools to light your world:Scriptable object backend for quick and easy saving.A fully 3D mesh-based workflow means that effects can be infinitely scaled with no loss in quality!Dynamic and customizable depth fading that allows you to display and hide the light effects based on the depth of the scene.Advanced camera fading that fades light effects in and out based on the distance to the camera.Custom layering system for easy customization.Lightweight shader built-in with GPU instancing supportThe custom noise-based variation system smoothly interpolates light effects to a different color. Useful for everything from subtle, lazy light movement to sporadic, violent lighting.Global, local, and per-layer controls give you ultimate control over the way that you want the light to render in your scene.All shaders are built with Amplify Shader Editor for easy customization across Built-in and URP!Come prepared with out-of-the-box features:42 Premade light effects89 Light shapesTwo main shader typesFull inspector extensions built with quick and easy editing in mind from the startFully supports Built-In and URP for any platform!\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/battle-sound-library-magic-melee-fantasy-rpg/","title":"Battle Sound Library - Magic & Melee - Fantasy RPG","description":null,"body":"Hundreds of sound clips, and thousands upon thousands of mixes.

It is a \"data\" element, usually persistent.Palette provider: an active element, living in a Unity scene, that acts as a broker between palettes and colorers, pushing color updates to any relevant colorers.Colorer: an active element that contains the logic to apply one or more colors to a scene component (UI elements, 3D models materials and more). A colorer must be connected to a palette provider, from which it retrieves colors for the color identifiers specified in its configuration.Ready to use Colorers for Unity components using color properties (UI elements, Materials etc) are included. That said, programmers can easily extend the system with additional custom colorers (and providers).You can improve your workflow with a new, more reasonable way to setup colors in Unity, with low friction and no compromises on your project organization.Anything can be done through the inspector if you want, but it's also easy to use the system through code only if you prefer.Palettes can be imported from commonly used third party formats and edited in the inspector, and in more advanced scenarios can be loaded at runtime from external files.The asset contents are laid out to be easily packaged for use in the Package Manager, if you want to easily import it (maybe including your own customizations) from multiple projects.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/runtime-editor/","title":"Runtime Editor","description":null,"body":"Runtime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs that help you create scene editor, game level editor, or your own modeling applicationRuntime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs designed to help you create a scene editor, game level editor, or build your own modeling application.

Add battle-tested cross-platform input to your game. Rewired is input that works.Rewired is an advanced input system that completely redefines how you work with input, giving you an unprecedented level of control over one of the most important components of your game.Website | Documentation | Forum Thread |  Free TrialNative InputRewired is not just another Unity input wrapper like other packages. Rewired supports many platforms that Unity supports with extended native support on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Rewired leverages native libraries to access input devices directly, allowing for far more control over input. This makes possible some very powerful features such as full hot-plugging support for joysticks, support for more than 20 buttons per controller, gamepad vibration, and more. Rewired is the only input system available for Unity with native support for all these platforms and the only to offer these advanced features. For other platforms, Rewired utilizes Unity's input system so you still get access to all the other features it provides.Player-CentricRewired features a player-centric input system making it the ideal solution for multi-player games. Controllers are intelligently auto-assigned to players on connect/disconnect, so you don't have to worry about what controllers each player owns. Access input by player instead of controller, so you always get the result you expect regardless of what controllers the player is using.Controller MapsRewired features a powerful controller mapping system that allows you to create highly complex input schemes for any style of game. Map supported controllers by logically named elements instead of cryptic Axis 0, etc. Maps stack so you can create different maps for different game modes and switch between them easily. Create default controller layouts for a variety of controllers and allow the player to customize his own mappings. Save and load maps via XML.Intelligent Hot-PluggingRewired solves all of Unity's hot plugging problems on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Stadia. (All other supported platforms depend on Unity's hot-plugging support.) No more forcing your players to quit and restart when they change joysticks. No more guessing which controller is which. It just works.Input EditorEdit all your inputs from a powerful and easy to use editor. No coding just to add an action like some systems. Edit players, action and map categories, alternate map layouts, joystick, keyboard, mouse, and custom controller maps, input behaviors, and more from one convenient interface.Cross PlatformRewired takes the hassle out of cross-platform input. Supported controllers have been mapped for consistency on Windows, Windows 10 Universal, OSX, Linux, iOS, tvOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Webplayers. Rewired also supports PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Switch, Stadia, PSM, WebGL, NVidia Shield, and other Android-based consoles.Supported ControllersRewired supports virtually any USB or Bluetooth controller via user mapping, and provides extended support for many common controllers of all types with more added all the time. Supported controllers are fully mapable by element name and have standardized axis directions.Control MapperRewired includes a complete, responsive, cross-platform runtime control remapping system. Simply add it to your project and configure it and your players can remap all their controls during the game! Highly configurable with built-in theme and language systems. Includes automatic or customized saving and loading of user data.Touch ControlsRewired comes with a set of customizable, on-screen Touch Controls suitable for mobile platforms and built using Unity UI. Use the included joysticks, buttons, touchpad, tilt control, and more directly in your games, or customize them fully to your needs.More Features• Get input by polling or use input events.• Custom Controllers allow any source to be used to drive the controller's element values (for on-screeen touch controllers and more).• Supports 128+ buttons and 32+ axes per controller on Windows, OSX, and Linux.• Support for special controller features such as gamepad vibration and DualShock 4 touchpad, lights, and gyro.• Assign multiple controllers per player.• Share controllers (like the keyboard) among players with separate maps for each player.• Enable and disable maps by category for switching between game modes with different controls.• Create user controller remapping screens with named controller elements, select a named controller from a list, and more.• Controller element assignment conflict checking functions.• Controller Templates makes defining maps for similar controllers quick and easy.• Input Behaviors allow you to create actions that share similar properties without having to duplicate information.• Double-press/click support with customizable timing.• Keyboard modifier support with up to 3 simultaneous modifier keys.• Axis calibration (min, max, zero, deadzone).• ZERO bytes of memory allocated per-frame during gameplay means no garbage collection overhead.• Works with many other packages from the Asset Store including:• UFPS: Ultimate First Person Shooter• UFPS• PlayMaker• Behavior Designer• Bolt• Cinemachine• Third Person Controller• Dialogue System• Corgi Engine• Realistic FPS Prefab• Inventory Pro• Motion Controller• ORK Framework• Quest System Pro• Realistic Tank Controller• Deftly• Universal Fighting Engine• UFE2• Racing Game Starter Kit• iRDS• GAC• Rex Engine• uSim• uPlatformer• Quest Machine• Rucksack - Multiplayer Inventory System• Space Combat Kit• Ultimate Character Controller• First Person Controller• UTPS: Ultimate Third Person Shooter• UFPM: Ultimate First Person Melee• UTPM: Ultimate Third Person Melee• So much more!See the Rewired website for more information.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/onejs/","title":"OneJS","description":null,"body":"OneJS brings JavaScript and many beloved web techs to Unity, seamlessly integrating with UI Toolkit without the need for a browser or webview.Visit onejs.com for Documentation and TutorialsDiscord • Youtube • Twitter/X • Github(Familiarity with React and Typescript is recommended)OneJS brings the power of React-style workflows to Unity UI development.

Please check the Upgrade Guide if you're using an older version of Unity or upgrading from an older version of Animancer.Animancer allows you to play animations on-demand and control all their details without any additional setup steps. It solves the major problems with Animator Controllers and can either replace them entirely or work alongside them. This makes animations much easier to work with in all stages of development from basic prototyping through to maintaining and debugging complex systems.You can try out all the Features for FREE with Animancer Lite then seamlessly upgrade to Animancer Pro if needed.It has plenty of detailed Samples to get you started,an extensive User Manual that explains how everything works,and even an introduction to C# in Unity in case you are new to programming. The Platformer Game Kit demonstrates how Animancer can be used in a more complex environment.Features:❶ Quick Play -&gt;Play animations on-demand without any unnecessary setup steps. Just get an AnimationClip and call animancer.Play(clip).❷ Easy Waiting -&gt;Register an End Event or yield return an AnimancerState inside a Coroutine to wait for an animation to finish.❸ Smooth Transitions -&gt;Blend between animations over time linearly or using a Custom Curve to ensure that your characters always move smoothly.❹ Flexible Structure -&gt;Organise your animations using data structures like arrays and Scriptable Objects and avoid Magic Strings.❺ Live Inspector -&gt;View the current details of your animations in the Inspector with manual controls for debugging and testing.❻ Finite State Machines -&gt;Animancer comes with a flexible FSM system which is entirely separate from the animation system. They work well together, but you can very easily modify it or use any other system you prefer.❼ High Performance -&gt;Animancer can be more efficient than other systems, though in most cases the differences are small enough not to matter either way.❽ Smooth Integration -&gt;Most plugins developed for other animation systems should work out of the box with Animancer and it supports features likeHumanoid Animation Retargeting,Generic Rigs,Sprite animations,Root Motion,Animation Events, andInverse Kinematics (IK).Animancer Pro Features: you can try out the following features for FREE in the Unity Editor with Animancer Lite, but you will need to purchase Animancer Pro to use them in a runtime build or access the Source Code.❶ Total Control -&gt;You have full access to and control over all animation details in runtime scripts, including their speed, time, and blend weight.❷ Simple Configuration -&gt;Manage the details of your animations in the Inspector so they can be edited as part of a scene or prefab.❸ Custom Events -&gt;Register Event callbacks to be triggered at specific times during an animation without the hassle of Unity's regular Animation Events.❹ Animation Layers -&gt;Manage multiple animation sets at the same time (generally on different body parts). Layers can either override or add to each other and you can fade them in and out just like individual animations.❺ Animator Controllers -&gt;Animancer does not require the use of Animator Controllers, but it does support a Hybrid approach which uses them alongside direct AnimationClip references for different tasks. You can even mix multiple Animator Controllers on a single character.❻ Animation Mixers -&gt;Blend between animations based on any input parameter much like Blend Trees.
