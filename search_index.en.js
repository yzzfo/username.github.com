The transfer of rights took place on 23/08/2021.A big update of the tool and the addition of a huge number of functionality will be released soon. If you have ideas for this tool, you can email me: uladzislau78@gmail.com‚óã OverviewPhysics Scatter allows you to scatter objects that follow physics, directly from the Editor! This means that you won't have to painfully rotate, translate, scale, and adjust the objects in the scene to make their position look realistic. Just select the objects you wish to scatter and drop them in the scene. They'll fall naturally one on top of the other, or on top of other components of your scene, in the best possible way, with minimum effort for the developer!&nbsp;‚óã Why PhysX Painter deserves your attention‚úì You can scatter multiple objects at the same time and apply random rotation or scale to them.‚úì The Physics Scatter can do anything that a normal object scatter can do. Random rotation, scale, offset placement, global and individual settings for objects, are all included here. But, in addition to this, you can apply physics effects to your objects! Not only those you scattered, but also (if you wish) those that you have lying around in the scene.‚úì A set of effects is included to create unique scenes. For example, you can scatter objects around and then apply an explosion effect. While the objects are in the air, you can freeze them, and use this amazing effect of objects frozen mid-air during an explosion in your scene! This opens up to a huge amount of new possibilities for scenes creation!‚úì The effects included are Explosion, Blackhole and SimpleForce. They are fully parameterized, allowing effects of different size, power, vertical offset and more.

For even faster nice looking results, some properties are automatically bound to the Spot light attached.&gt;&gt; Limitations &lt;&lt;- It only supports 'spotlights' (beams shaped like a cone). Point lights or directional lights are not supported.- The plugin fully works with Deferred Rendering path: like any semi-transparent objects, beams are rendered using a Forward rendering pass on top of the Deferred one. This is a well known limitation of the Deferred Rendering technique.- Since this plugin requires custom scripts execution, it won't work for a VRChat world using the VRCSDK.Please consider rating and writing a review on the Asset Store page if you like it!

You are encouraged to adjust/duplicate the prefabs to tailer them to your specific needs.‚Ä¢ Triggering and spawning effects through gameplay/events is expected to be handled by your own systems, such as a character/AI/boat controller (since they all differ). This asset uses standard Unity components, no special sauce, so general Unity concepts come into play.‚ö° Performance:The render pass involved does not rely on an additional camera and integrates natively into URP's excisting culling/batching process. Providing best in class performance, no matter the world's complexity or scale.The rendering range and resolution are the two influential, but scalable, factors. Configurable per render feature.Typically occupies about 96mb in GPU memory. Down to &lt;1mb for the lowest quality settings.‚úîÔ∏è Compatibility:‚Ä¢ No exceptions from Stylized Water 2's compatibility details.‚Ä¢ Supports all platforms.‚Ä¢ Scalabe to use on mobile hardware (requires Surface Foam material feature to be enabled).‚Ä¢ VR renderingüöß Restrictions:‚Ä¢ Displacement created by effects does not affect C# buoyancy information.‚Ä¢ Surface displacement requires the Tessellation feature to be enabled on the receiving water material, or by using a high-poly mesh for water.‚Ä¢ Rendering resolution scales down by the increase in rendering range. Super high detail close to the camera, whilst rendering over long distances (+1000m) is not realistic to expect.‚Ä¢ Rendering internally is done from a top-down perspective, as such planets or spherical worlds aren't compatible, neither is 2D.[ Refund policy ] Refunds cannot be granted for not having read the sections on this page\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/stylized-water-2/","title":"Stylized Water 2","description":null,"body":"Highly customizable to suit your art direction through various parameters.

Download the 'Standalone Stress Test' demo to see how MxM stacks up in performance.Included Demo Scene - The Demo Scene included with MxM includes a player controlled Robot Kyle with the ability to run around and perform some parkour vaults. The vault system shown here is for demonstration of MxM event features ONLY and is not intended to be a production ready vault system.What is Motion MatchingMotion Matching for Unity (MxM) is an alternative animation system to mecanim which enables fluid and responsive animation without the need of a state machine. There is no need to specify transitions, define conditions or keep track of complex animation logic. Motion Matching takes care of most of that for you resulting in unlimited starts, stops, plants and turns.Motion Matching achieves this by comparing the pose of the character and desired future trajectory (from player input) to all animations in your library. The system will pick the most appropriate time and clip to jump to. This all happens with lightning speed as it is implemented with Unity's new job system and burst compiler.Who is it for?MxM is not a plug and play asset. You need to understand basic scripting in Unity as an absolute minimum. However, strong programmers will make the most out of this asset. Intermediate level experience with Unity and programming in C# is recommended.MxM supports cut clips but mocap users and studios with high animation bandwidth will reap greater benefits from this asset.Platforms - While MxM may work on mobile devices, mobile platforms are not yet actively supportedDependencies - MxM requires a number of Unity packages from the package manager to work (e.g. Jobs). Some of these may be preview packages. However, these packages all behave in a stable manner with MxM. Please read the quick start guide for details.Animation Requirements - MxM may not work with all animation sets. Transition animations are required for good coverage and continuity. Please read the documentation for more info.Features: (v2.2.5)- Un-structured interactive animation- Fluid, natural and responsive animation output*- No need for state machines and explicit transitions- Powerful event system for character actions- Built in animation warping for actions like parkour - Support for multiple world contacts during actions (e.g. placing the hand on a ledge when vaulting)- Tagging system for control over movement types and stances- Built in layer system  - Fade between mecanim and MxM with a single function call - Lighting fast performance. MxM is multi-threaded and uses Unity's new Job system Burst Compiler and SIMD mathematics library- Blend spaces to cover animation gaps - Custom editors and inspectors to help manipulate data- Support for cut clips as well as uncut motion capture *- Works with most IK systems straight out of the box - Powerful debugging tools- see the documentation for moreAnimation output quality and responsiveness is dependent on the quality and responsiveness of source animations. Not all animation sets will work. Please see animation requirements for more details. Only partial support for 'Unity Animation Rigging' due to Unity bugs and limitations.Documentation:- Quick Start Guide- User Manual- Video TutorialsWarning: Motion Matching is a generic animation system that outputs animation. It does not handle procedural animation / IK or game-play code. A good level of scripting competence is recommended to convey game-play information to the motion matching system.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/mesh-baker/","title":"Mesh Baker","description":null,"body":"Improve performance!

Lumen is a one-stop solution to stylized, performant volumetric lighting in stylized games.Features THREE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS of light that work together to dramatically stylize your game worlds:Do the lights in your scene feel lackluster? Do you want your audience to feel the warmth of the lights in your game? LUMEN LIGHT FLARES add a subtle halo to the lights in your scene providing an effect similar to that of volumetric point lights. This effect can be turned to the extreme as well filling your scenes with majestic glow and powerful auras‚Äîa must for any mystical item that your players may encounter!The LUMEN STATIC RAYS are a simple way to achieve any sort of volumetric ray. Godrays, sunshafts, spotlights, 2D, 3D, or anything in between, these rays do it all! Use these to add interest to your scene, direct the player's eye to important locations, fill the scene with moody lighting, or just make your scenes even prettier!Finally, LUMEN DYNAMIC RAYS use vertex colors and a custom shader to dynamically scale and contort the rays to a specific angle in real-time! Use these rays to track the sun dynamically, point rays at a moving target, or fake real-time volumetric lighting!WHY MESH-BASED EFFECTS?Built on a mesh-based, procedural material, Lumen throws out all of the calculations that most volumetric lighting solutions need by replacing the traditional mathematics with a simple vertex lit shader! This allows your effects to be calculated cheaply so that you can focus on the aesthetics of your scene, without worrying about the framerate decreasing. Beyond this, the lack of textures allows your disk space to be minimized without reducing the quality of the flares and rays that make your scene beautiful!Powerful tools to light your world:Scriptable object backend for quick and easy saving.A fully 3D mesh-based workflow means that effects can be infinitely scaled with no loss in quality!Dynamic and customizable depth fading that allows you to display and hide the light effects based on the depth of the scene.Advanced camera fading that fades light effects in and out based on the distance to the camera.Custom layering system for easy customization.Lightweight shader built-in with GPU instancing supportThe custom noise-based variation system smoothly interpolates light effects to a different color. Useful for everything from subtle, lazy light movement to sporadic, violent lighting.Global, local, and per-layer controls give you ultimate control over the way that you want the light to render in your scene.All shaders are built with Amplify Shader Editor for easy customization across Built-in and URP!Come prepared with out-of-the-box features:42 Premade light effects89 Light shapesTwo main shader typesFull inspector extensions built with quick and easy editing in mind from the startFully supports Built-In and URP for any platform!\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/battle-sound-library-magic-melee-fantasy-rpg/","title":"Battle Sound Library - Magic & Melee - Fantasy RPG","description":null,"body":"Hundreds of sound clips, and thousands upon thousands of mixes.

Also the URP and HDRP versions have not been fully tested and are not guaranteed to work on VR, some URP modules have been confirmed by users to work on Multi pass VR, but the system in general will not support officially VR going forward.Not all parts of the system is for every platform, so not all parts are guaranteed to work on Mobile, or WebGL or other special platforms like consoles. Windows is the official fully supported platform where everything is tested and submitted from.() Note that Ethereal core, which includes the complete Ethereal functionality, is included in the Sky Master ULTIMATE URP, currently available through Google Drive download to all Sky Master ULTIMATE users. The Ethereal standalone asset has an extra library of Forest assets and demos and many more demo scenes for reference, so an upgrade path is offered if those extra demos and URP forest assets and foliage shaders are needed.Sky Master ULTIMATE asset is for Standard Pipeline and users of the system can enter the testing phase of the upcoming Sky Master ULTIMATE URP and Sky Master ULTIMATE HDRP assets, each remade from ground up for the specific pipeline.

It is a \"data\" element, usually persistent.Palette provider: an active element, living in a Unity scene, that acts as a broker between palettes and colorers, pushing color updates to any relevant colorers.Colorer: an active element that contains the logic to apply one or more colors to a scene component (UI elements, 3D models materials and more). A colorer must be connected to a palette provider, from which it retrieves colors for the color identifiers specified in its configuration.Ready to use Colorers for Unity components using color properties (UI elements, Materials etc) are included. That said, programmers can easily extend the system with additional custom colorers (and providers).You can improve your workflow with a new, more reasonable way to setup colors in Unity, with low friction and no compromises on your project organization.Anything can be done through the inspector if you want, but it's also easy to use the system through code only if you prefer.Palettes can be imported from commonly used third party formats and edited in the inspector, and in more advanced scenarios can be loaded at runtime from external files.The asset contents are laid out to be easily packaged for use in the Package Manager, if you want to easily import it (maybe including your own customizations) from multiple projects.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/runtime-editor/","title":"Runtime Editor","description":null,"body":"Runtime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs that help you create scene editor, game level editor, or your own modeling applicationRuntime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs designed to help you create a scene editor, game level editor, or build your own modeling application.

Rewired is input that works.Rewired is an advanced input system that completely redefines how you work with input, giving you an unprecedented level of control over one of the most important components of your game.Website | Documentation | Forum Thread |  Free TrialNative InputRewired is not just another Unity input wrapper like other packages. Rewired supports many platforms that Unity supports with extended native support on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Rewired leverages native libraries to access input devices directly, allowing for far more control over input. This makes possible some very powerful features such as full hot-plugging support for joysticks, support for more than 20 buttons per controller, gamepad vibration, and more. Rewired is the only input system available for Unity with native support for all these platforms and the only to offer these advanced features. For other platforms, Rewired utilizes Unity's input system so you still get access to all the other features it provides.Player-CentricRewired features a player-centric input system making it the ideal solution for multi-player games. Controllers are intelligently auto-assigned to players on connect/disconnect, so you don't have to worry about what controllers each player owns. Access input by player instead of controller, so you always get the result you expect regardless of what controllers the player is using.Controller MapsRewired features a powerful controller mapping system that allows you to create highly complex input schemes for any style of game. Map supported controllers by logically named elements instead of cryptic Axis 0, etc. Maps stack so you can create different maps for different game modes and switch between them easily. Create default controller layouts for a variety of controllers and allow the player to customize his own mappings. Save and load maps via XML.Intelligent Hot-PluggingRewired solves all of Unity's hot plugging problems on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Stadia. (All other supported platforms depend on Unity's hot-plugging support.) No more forcing your players to quit and restart when they change joysticks. No more guessing which controller is which. It just works.Input EditorEdit all your inputs from a powerful and easy to use editor. No coding just to add an action like some systems. Edit players, action and map categories, alternate map layouts, joystick, keyboard, mouse, and custom controller maps, input behaviors, and more from one convenient interface.Cross PlatformRewired takes the hassle out of cross-platform input. Supported controllers have been mapped for consistency on Windows, Windows 10 Universal, OSX, Linux, iOS, tvOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Webplayers. Rewired also supports PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Switch, Stadia, PSM, WebGL, NVidia Shield, and other Android-based consoles.Supported ControllersRewired supports virtually any USB or Bluetooth controller via user mapping, and provides extended support for many common controllers of all types with more added all the time. Supported controllers are fully mapable by element name and have standardized axis directions.Control MapperRewired includes a complete, responsive, cross-platform runtime control remapping system. Simply add it to your project and configure it and your players can remap all their controls during the game! Highly configurable with built-in theme and language systems.

Please check the Upgrade Guide if you're using an older version of Unity or upgrading from an older version of Animancer.Animancer allows you to play animations on-demand and control all their details without any additional setup steps. It solves the major problems with Animator Controllers and can either replace them entirely or work alongside them. This makes animations much easier to work with in all stages of development from basic prototyping through to maintaining and debugging complex systems.You can try out all the Features for FREE with Animancer Lite then seamlessly upgrade to Animancer Pro if needed.It has plenty of detailed Samples to get you started,an extensive User Manual that explains how everything works,and even an introduction to C# in Unity in case you are new to programming. The Platformer Game Kit demonstrates how Animancer can be used in a more complex environment.Features:‚ù∂ Quick Play -&gt;Play animations on-demand without any unnecessary setup steps. Just get an AnimationClip and call animancer.Play(clip).‚ù∑ Easy Waiting -&gt;Register an End Event or yield return an AnimancerState inside a Coroutine to wait for an animation to finish.‚ù∏ Smooth Transitions -&gt;Blend between animations over time linearly or using a Custom Curve to ensure that your characters always move smoothly.‚ùπ Flexible Structure -&gt;Organise your animations using data structures like arrays and Scriptable Objects and avoid Magic Strings.‚ù∫ Live Inspector -&gt;View the current details of your animations in the Inspector with manual controls for debugging and testing.‚ùª Finite State Machines -&gt;Animancer comes with a flexible FSM system which is entirely separate from the animation system. They work well together, but you can very easily modify it or use any other system you prefer.‚ùº High Performance -&gt;Animancer can be more efficient than other systems, though in most cases the differences are small enough not to matter either way.‚ùΩ Smooth Integration -&gt;Most plugins developed for other animation systems should work out of the box with Animancer and it supports features likeHumanoid Animation Retargeting,Generic Rigs,Sprite animations,Root Motion,Animation Events, andInverse Kinematics (IK).Animancer Pro Features: you can try out the following features for FREE in the Unity Editor with Animancer Lite, but you will need to purchase Animancer Pro to use them in a runtime build or access the Source Code.‚ù∂ Total Control -&gt;You have full access to and control over all animation details in runtime scripts, including their speed, time, and blend weight.‚ù∑ Simple Configuration -&gt;Manage the details of your animations in the Inspector so they can be edited as part of a scene or prefab.‚ù∏ Custom Events -&gt;Register Event callbacks to be triggered at specific times during an animation without the hassle of Unity's regular Animation Events.‚ùπ Animation Layers -&gt;Manage multiple animation sets at the same time (generally on different body parts). Layers can either override or add to each other and you can fade them in and out just like individual animations.‚ù∫ Animator Controllers -&gt;Animancer does not require the use of Animator Controllers, but it does support a Hybrid approach which uses them alongside direct AnimationClip references for different tasks. You can even mix multiple Animator Controllers on a single character.‚ùª Animation Mixers -&gt;Blend between animations based on any input parameter much like Blend Trees. For example, you could blend between Idle, Walk, and Run based on how far the player tilts a joystick to allow them to move at any speed.‚ùº Tools -&gt;Various utilities for creating and modifying animations which can then be played with Animancer or any other animation system that supports them. These tools allow you to work with Sprites and Sprite based animations in bulk, such as renaming multiple Sprites at once or generating animations from them based on their names. ‚ùΩ Customisation -&gt;Use Unity's Animation Job system for low level access to the animation stream and create Custom State types to implement procedural animation, custom blending algorithms, or any other behaviour you can think of.‚ùæ Source Code -&gt;The full source code of Animancer is included as plain C# files with detailed comments so you can see all its internal workings, track down bugs, make any modifications you see fit, and avoid becoming dependant on the developer to fix issues (but feel free to use the Help and FAQ page if you need support). The Animancer.Lite.dll included in the Animancer Pro package are empty dummies to ensure seamless upgrades from Animancer Lite, so they contain no code and are not included in builds.Check out the Documentation and Samples to get started.Note that the Samples use various third party art assets under the CC0 license.Upgrade Policy: minor updates and fixes will always be free. Major updates may charge an upgrade fee depending primarily on the scope and development effort involved. Users who choose not to update can continue using the version they purchased in the Unity releases it supports.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/a-pathfinding-project-pro/","title":"A* Pathfinding Project Pro","description":null,"body":"The A* Pathfinding Project is a powerful and easy to use pathfinding system for Unity.
